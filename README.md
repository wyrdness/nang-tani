## Overview

Nang Tani (นางตานี), also romanized as Nang Ta-khian or Mae Tani, represents one of Thailand's most beloved and enduring spirit traditions—the ghost of a beautiful young woman who dwells within banana trees, particularly the *tani* variety (*Musa sapientum* var. *suavis*). Within Thai supernatural taxonomy, she occupies a unique position as simultaneously ghost (*phi*), nature spirit, and protective guardian, embodying the complex relationship between Thai communities and their natural environment.

The spirit manifests as a young woman of extraordinary beauty wearing traditional Thai dress in green or white, with long flowing black hair adorned with jasmine flowers. She appears most commonly during full moon nights, standing beneath or emerging from banana trees, her presence announced by the sweet scent of jasmine and ripening bananas. Unlike many malevolent spirits in Thai folklore, Nang Tani is predominantly benevolent—protective of women and children, helpful to respectful humans, and vengeful only when her tree home faces harm.

Thai tradition describes Nang Tani as the spirit of a woman who died during pregnancy or childbirth, her soul bound to the banana tree where she perished or was buried. This origin connects her to broader Southeast Asian traditions of *phi tai hong* (ghosts of violent or untimely death) while distinguishing her through specific arboreal association. The banana tree (*ton kluai*) holds particular significance in Thai culture—used in ceremonies, offerings, and daily life—making its resident spirit especially important in community spiritual ecology.

Nang Tani manifests protective functions: guarding households with banana trees, ensuring bountiful harvests, protecting pregnant women, and occasionally bestowing blessings or wealth upon respectful devotees. However, she possesses a fierce protective instinct for her tree home. Cutting down a banana tree inhabited by Nang Tani without proper propitiation rituals invites serious misfortune—illness, accidents, business failures, or death. Stories abound of construction projects halted, developers falling ill, and workers injured after disturbing banana groves.

Contemporary Thailand maintains strong belief in Nang Tani, with urban and rural communities alike showing respect through offerings, proper tree cutting ceremonies, and avoidance of banana groves at night. The spirit appears frequently in Thai popular culture—films, television series, novels, and comic books—ensuring transmission of traditions to younger generations while adapting to modern contexts.

## Etymology & Names

### Primary Name
- **Nang Tani** (นางตานี) — From Thai: *nang* (lady/woman) + *tani* (a variety of banana tree, *Musa sapientum* var. *suavis*). The name directly identifies her as "Lady of the Tani Banana."

### Alternative Names

| Name | Language/Region | Meaning | Usage Context |
|------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| Mae Tani | Thai | Mother Tani | Respectful address |
| Nang Ta-khian | Thai | Lady of the Ta-khian | Sometimes confused/conflated |
| Phi Nang Tani | Thai | Ghost Lady Tani | Formal spiritual terminology |
| Nang Kluai | Thai | Lady Banana | Informal/regional |
| Nang Mai | Thai | Lady Tree | Generic tree spirit term |

**Important Distinction**: Nang Tani (banana tree) should not be confused with Nang Ta-khian (นางตะเคียน), the spirit of the hopea tree, though both are female tree spirits with similar protective functions. Thai folklore distinguishes between various tree spirits, each associated with specific species.

**Linguistic Note**: The *tani* banana variety name may derive from Pali/Sanskrit *dhānya* (grain/wealth), reflecting the banana's agricultural importance. The full name *Musa sapientum* means "fruit of the wise," assigned by Linnaeus, referencing the fruit's spiritual and cultural significance.

## Origin Traditions

### Primary Origin Story

The most common Thai tradition explains Nang Tani's genesis:

**Narrative:**
A beautiful young woman, pregnant with her first child, sought privacy in a banana grove during labor complications. Unable to return to the village, she died during childbirth beneath a large banana tree. Her spirit, bound by violent death and maternal attachment, merged with the tree. She remains eternally young, beautiful, and connected to the tree, protecting other women from similar fates while seeking peace through offerings and respect.

**Variations:**
- Woman fled abusive relationship, died near tree
- Murdered pregnant woman buried beneath banana tree
- Woman died of heartbreak, spirit chose tree as home
- Multiple women died in banana grove, collective spirit
- Ancient guardian spirit choosing human form

### Alternative Origins

#### Divine Appointment
Some traditions describe Nang Tani as appointed guardian:

- **Brahmin version**: Heavenly *apsara* (celestial dancer) assigned to protect earth's banana trees
- **Buddhist version**: *deva* (deity) taking form to guard specific location
- **Animist version**: Primordial nature spirit predating human presence

#### Reincarnation Cycle
Buddhist interpretation positions Nang Tani within karmic cycle:

- Spirit of woman with unfinished business
- Karmic debt binding soul to earthly location
- Awaiting merit accumulation for better rebirth
- Tree dwelling as intermediate existence

## Sighting Reports & Encounters

### Historical Account (1920s)

Recorded by **Prince Damrong Rajanubhab**, Thai historian and scholar:

> "In the village of Ban Pho, near Ayutthaya, the villagers maintain strict customs regarding the banana grove at the wat [temple] boundary. A large *tani* grove, perhaps forty years old, was said to house Nang Tani. During Loy Krathong festival under full moon, several villagers reported seeing a young woman in green traditional dress walking among the trees, her hair adorned with jasmine. She was observed for perhaps five minutes before disappearing. The abbot confirmed that offerings had been made to the tree spirit earlier that day, and such manifestations were considered auspicious for the coming year."

**Context**: Documented in *Collected Essays on Thai Culture and Customs*, 1926.

### Contemporary Account (2018)

Bangkok resident **Somchai Prasomsuk**, interviewed after tree cutting incident:

> "I run construction company. We bought land in Thonburi district for new building project. Old house had large banana grove—maybe ten big trees. My foreman said we should make ceremony, but I thought this is superstition, waste of time and money. We started cutting trees without permission ritual. First day, worker's chainsaw broke three times. Second day, worker fell from ladder, broke arm. Third day, I got very sick—high fever, strange dreams about angry woman in green telling me to stop. My wife found Thai spirit medium. She came to site, said Nang Tani very angry. We had to stop everything, bring monk for proper ceremony, make big offering, promise to plant new banana trees in corner of property. After ceremony, no more problems. Now I always do proper ritual before cutting any tree. I believe now."

**Context**: Reported in Thai paranormal website forum, verified by local newspaper article about construction delays.

### Temple Monk Account (2020)

**Phra Ajahn Somchai**, abbot of Wat Nang Tani, Ayutthaya:

> "This temple has been here for over 200 years, and the banana grove is original. People come from many provinces to make offerings to Nang Tani here. They ask for help with pregnancy, childbirth, protection of children. Some people see her on full moon nights—beautiful young woman with jasmine flowers. She doesn't harm anyone who comes with respect. In 2019, provincial office wanted to widen the road, would need to cut some banana trees. We had very long negotiation. Finally, they agreed to redesign road to save the trees. Was it because they believed in Nang Tani, or because community protested? Both, I think. This is how it works in Thailand—practical and spiritual together."

### Tourist Encounter (2022)

**Emma Blackwood**, British visitor, documented experience:

> "I was staying at homestay in Chiang Mai province. Beautiful traditional house with banana trees in garden. Host family explained about Nang Tani, making offerings every week. I'm quite skeptical usually, but wanted to be respectful. One night around 11 PM, I went outside because I heard singing—beautiful female voice singing in Thai. I looked toward banana trees and saw what looked like a woman in traditional dress, kind of glowing in the moonlight. I watched for maybe thirty seconds before I got scared and went inside. In the morning, I asked the family if anyone was singing last night. The grandmother smiled and said 'You saw Nang Tani! This is good luck for you.' I don't know what I saw, but I definitely saw something."
